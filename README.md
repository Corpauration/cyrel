CY Tech school information tool for the Pau Campus by Corpauration.

It uses the university environment (Celcat) server Api's (not the admin API), to give various information, in particular
the timetable.

It also gives other information thanks to the addition of students.

## Frontends

Cyrel frontends are made with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).

Currently, we only provide the website and android version.  
However, we will soon release a windows and linux version.  

The code for this future version is already partially there:   
feel free to build it, but at your own risk.

## Backend

The backend is [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) API written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).   
You can find it there : [cyrel-backend](https://github.com/Corpauration/cyrel-backend).

Its current functionalities are:  

- See schedule
- Create and see homeworks
- View free rooms
